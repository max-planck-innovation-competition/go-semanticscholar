To determine if these two different spatial biases are specific to different types of saccades, we studied prosaccades, antisaccades and memory-guided saccades in humans. The diagonal effect occurred not with prosaccades but with antisaccades and memory-guided saccades with long intervals, consistent with hypotheses that it originates in computations of goal location under conditions of uncertainty. There was a small upward bias for memory-guided saccades but not prosaccades or antisaccades. Thus this bias is not a general effect of target uncertainty but a property specific to memory-guided saccades.","inCitations":["9b50a99a863f12df2297d27fc6b31fdd14b559a3","3d7bbf4e3a07cb82f06a47cfc7edfe3a6ec3dc5d"],"pdfUrls":["https://boris.unibe.ch/67693/1/2299-8523-1-PB.pdf"],"title":"Systematic diagonal and vertical errors in antisaccades and memory-guided saccades","doi":"10.16910/jemr.3.3.5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.16910/jemr.3.3.5","venue":""}

Methods for analyzing comparative costs for CCS implementation in Coal plants, in terms of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and cost per ton CO2 removed or avoided ($/tonCO2 ) are described. The contribution of compression to LCOE is significant and highly dependent on configuration. Critical inputs required for accurately calculating compressor power and some common errors that significantly impact the results of power consumption can increase the estimated power required by 40%. Sensitivity analyses for critical compressor characteristics are provided. In addition, the impact of energy (heat) integration on the overall economics of the plant can reduce the LCOE penalty. Finally, configuration parameters for systems meeting the national targets of 35% LCOE penalty for CCS costs are explored.Copyright © 2010 by ASME","inCitations":["f26e80b010e635c17e2ad33e68ac5f222e434929","d65470103e50e409757490622f67a41ba845068a","0cfefab5a5c5fa8abee96c80a2df799872e32ed8","0b23b4dc137871b4c33043e1a061e3d5e3ae8da1","a3ef7927f5c382af3ab2baf13c698fa23e11a1a8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Impact of CO2 Compressor Characteristics and Integration in Post Combustion Carbon Sequestration Comparative Economic Analysis","doi":"10.1115/GT2010-22974","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/GT2010-22974","venue":""}

The constitutive equation and hot processing map of the alloy were built up according to its hot deformation behavior and hot working characteristics. The deformation activation energy of the alloy is 203.005 kJ/mol. An instability region appears in the hot deformation temperature of 600–700 °C and the strain rate range of 0.32–10 s –1 when the true strain of the alloy is up to 0.7. Under the optimal hot deformation condition of 800 °C and 10 s –1 the prepared specimen has good surface quality and interior structure.

Ion measurements made from lunar orbit give us the information regarding interactions between the solar wind and the planetary surface. The ion mass spectrometry also provides the surface composition and the source and loss mechanisms of planetary tenuous atmospheres. An ion energy mass spectrometer MAP-PACE IMA onboard a lunar orbiter SELENE(KAGUYA) has detected low-energy ions from the Moon at an altitude of 100 km. IMA has identified ion species of He+, C+, O+, Na+, K+ and Ar+. The measurements of ions from the Moon enable us to continuously monitor the lunar exospheres. The 1.5-year observation of SELENE(KAGUYA) shows that the ions from the Moon have been detected both when the Moon is exposed to the solar wind and when it is in the Earth’s lobe region. The observation suggests that the solar wind is not the dominant source mechanism for the lunar exospheres. Moreover, the MAPPACE IMA shows the dependence on the solar zenith angle and the dawn-dusk asymmetry. We report the features of the lunar exospheres obtained by the SELENE(KAGUYA) observation and discuss the source mechanism of the lunar exospheres.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2010/EGU2010-7825.pdf","http://sprg.isas.jaxa.jp/seminar_old/seminar_resume_2010/20100602_Yokota.pdf"],"title":"Observation of ions from the Moon by MAP-PACE IMA onboard SELENE(KAGUYA)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Objective To analyze the association between specific distances from invasive tumor to surgical margin and LR in patients with OCSCC. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 432 patients treated via en bloc resection for OCSCC between 2005 and 2014 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. In all cases, permanent margin evaluation was performed on the main tumor specimen and with intraoperative frozen section margin assessment from the tumor bed. Main Outcomes and Measures The LR rate based on minimum millimeter distance between invasive tumor and inked main specimen margin. Results Of the 432 participants, 252 (58%) were men and 180 (42%) were women (mean age, 62.14 years; range, 19-99 years). In each case, the LR rate was analyzed in relation to each millimeter distance of invasive cancer from the inked main specimen margin, with results showing an exponential inverse relationship. The LR rate for microscopic positive margins was 44% (95% CI, 34%-55%); for margins less than 1 mm, 28% (95% CI, 18%-41%); for 1 mm, 17% (95% CI, 8%-31%); for 2 mm, 13% (95% CI, 6%-27%); for 3 mm, 13% (95% CI, 5%-32%); for 4 mm, 14% (95% CI, 5%-35%); and for 5 mm or greater, 11% (95% CI, 6%-18%). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve identified a cutoff of less than 1 mm as appropriate for classifying higher risk of local recurrence. Regardless of margin distance, resection of additional tissue beyond 1 mm based on intraoperative frozen section was not associated with improved local control. Conclusions and Relevance The commonly used cutoff of 5 mm for a close margin lacks an evidential basis in predicting local recurrence. Invasive tumor within 1 mm of the permanent specimen margin is associated with a significantly higher local recurrence rate, though there is no significant difference for greater distances. This study suggests that a cutoff of less than 1 mm identifies patients at increased local recurrence risk who may benefit from additional treatment. Analysis of the tumor specimen rather than the tumor bed is necessary for this determination.","inCitations":["3bd212759bd195a70246eac8f67763f1d738c3a9","0dba4e86d3ccbc61aa1926b6e855c9cdb2b6a37c","0d4e849a2597d735c19d6661a04b0f4802af7619","d3cdb1437b9c57f836a1f92b542a825ccf1027a8","726f3803d8ceacb0231991ed9159a93f01463a75","c103856f12a575a7e31ceead5d31bffd53027d72","e9bc1484e5bd9ccd03264a70db1b2e081144ce1f","1c3c7b67c71afb0d0cfce789d0b7f99b1ac82f26","b8b80ea8b6eb60866cd93e038d96efbda772bc35","508a7b9edd88c0616e224881fc14b2137a6e57d3","5807b44048d861dd29ae46c0bb855bac9d898b6f","8731ebfe53e539c8b594d6f62d4378e11365ab57","b716c8dc5d84256c01d89e9c3527446216b1d51e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Definition of “Close Margin” in Oral Cancer Surgery and Association of Margin Distance With Local Recurrence Rate","doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2017.0548","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2017.0548","venue":"JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery"}

The model is based on finite element method, where each finite element represents a single crystal grain in the polycrystalline structure. The constitutive equations are integrated at each Gauss point by a return mapping algorithm. In this manner good stability and convergence of the model is achieved. Material properties for Ni-Ti alloy (50.8 at.% Ni) obtained from literature and from our own experiments were applied to the model and a sample calculation of a 3D model subjected to uniaxial loading was performed. The results were compared to experimental results obtained from tensile and compressive tests on a universal testing machine. In general the presented model predicts well the level of the superelastic stress plateau and maximum transformation strain in tension. Predictions in compression do not agree well with the experimental findings but the overall characteristics of the tension-compression asymmetry are predicted correctly.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://lab.fs.uni-lj.si/lanem/papers/brojan/2010_JM.pdf"],"title":"Micromechanical modelling of superelasticity in polycrystalline NiTi with non-constant Young ' s modulus","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This mutation occurs at a position homologous to that of the mutation Leu to Phe (L1014F) reportedly associated with knock-down resistance (kdr) to pyrethroids in a house fly strain. Another mutation reportedly associated with super-kdr in house fly was not found in H. virescens samples. In previous work, we found that one haplotype Hpy3 of a marker locus Hpy that lies approximately 5 kb away from the L1029H polymorphism in the gene, increased in frequency among survivors of selection with pyrethroids, presumably through \"hitch-hiking\" with a resistance-conferring mutation. Not all resistant individuals examined in this study carried the L1029H mutation, but only those that also carried Hpy3 haplotypes. Resistance has been genetically linked to hscp markers for the strain PEG87, but this strain was found not to carry the L1029H mutation. Assuming that the L1029H mutation does in fact confer resistance, this suggests that more than one sodium channel mutation may be contributing to pyrethroid resistance in field populations of H. virescens.","inCitations":["7fb4d7def458f287be040d462afc9a1e628622fe","313bdd1946c0a3cc968d47c17e3b15eb5adee174","c78f870b310b8c1dc499fe476cb177cdcb9337cb","3e066a8502059fe6f39bcc38ec09c81fe5841cf5","39dd0986185ab21ebf985ce97cfc69be833b2afb","b02d1a4192327cb4917ef7b24fbc0f1ab406d04c","1313e1e6457a20a738f1500a2ae156eeb92764e3","3c56d74af09255560fd652b5dae25fe708e48a16","004c7c15b46b70972aa4d50322106ef2a6cc8d2a","b7032e4ed2391f884311fd1e5cf4e6d8adf2287c","3959db6edb116ecaa20f57ca20389d43f82e0d27","82594954231acdccfccd23ecbcae591c6098aa70","59f31c9d15a9f36a4735d4fa1a426f77459001f0","07e61e0c9b6090468dec35732c778cdacc8ace78","366227b185eb24899149045496ad181677662314","16b9ca3593ec0eb7e13e2c5a0f3b5f2001c0234e","ec68aad23dbc039f31296aed0a6484da6fa18c51","22b7cf9c48d49dc84662ad3066fd7906d69f2a38","cac205ece2d709a67afdcd9fa3f9cf344c485db9","5f3fa85e2122a1d6c5483225da1d99a6b230ce9b","0684d6b23f90b3b3d9e1ebc993168c1faa955e7d","6f0f6844310412cb69e5c75d11aa41d93e4f6b36","95b54dfe8e7bd5dc6b46ab6422e3a75985ff41ed","35085d9c7efb2e21061c5c3904ae9a713e57ca2e","eeaa28dee216af3d1ae5a103132eafc3734ec97a","f5637e333c250d7bea2039c8a12ca8102b0d16fc","155e17ee3c445a8688227aaf4783e6ef09e2e7b1","2cdb42c59e98e095699fd53c4caef578a3584433","109ed87cb0976e95311d9f3de414600c1c10bfbd","ec4f4ac248f0b284890a8d8827b46ebdd771d966","b0f28930a0df2acaaaf346068032846674c3c9dc","f97d2d3bb31a37d9c43f60f58ae2f59ef6a247b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel mutation L1029H in sodium channel gene hscp associated with pyrethroid resistance for Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera:Noctuidae).","doi":"10.1016/S0965-1748(96)00077-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0965-1748%2896%2900077-X","venue":"Insect biochemistry and molecular biology"}

The surveys that were conducted through mainly carborne, airborne and in situ gamma-ray measurement devices, enabled to efficiently characterize the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of air dose rates induced by Caesium-134 and Caesium-137 in the terrestrial systems. These measurements revealed that radiation levels decreased at rates greater than expected from physical decay in 2011-2012 (up to a factor of 2), and dependent on the type of environment (i.e. urban, agricultural or forest). Unlike carborne measurements that may have been strongly influenced by the depuration of road surfaces, no obvious reason can be invoked for airborne measurements, especially above forests that are known to efficiently retain and recycle radiocaesium. The purpose of our research project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the data acquired by Japanese, and identify the environmental mechanisms or factors that may explain such decays. The methodology relies on the use of a process-based and spatially-distributed dynamic model that predicts radiocaesium transfer and associated air dose rates inside/above a terrestrial environment (e.g., forests, croplands, meadows, bare soils and urban areas). Despite the lack of site-specific data, our numerical study predicts decrease rates that are globally consistent with both aerial and in situ observations. The simulation at a flying altitude of 200 m indicated that ambient radiation levels decreased over the first 12 months by about 45% over dense urban areas, 15% above evergreen coniferous forests and between 2 and 12% above agricultural lands, owing to environmental processes that are identified and discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the decrease over evergreen coniferous regions might be due the combined effects of canopy depuration (through biological and physical mechanisms) and the shielding of gamma rays emitted from the forest floor by vegetation. Our study finally suggests that airborne surveys might have not reflected dose rates at ground level in forest systems, which were predicted to slightly increase by 5-10% during the same period of time.","inCitations":["d4d3ccf1cc1e683b980df371d29a61316948f536","8b0c4abd32982323b13b5ce0337253d27991c3eb"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2017/22/epjconf_icrs2017_08004.pdf"],"title":"Modelling the dynamics of ambient dose rates induced by radiocaesium in the Fukushima terrestrial environment.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.06.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.06.003","venue":"Journal of environmental radioactivity"}

During mating, male mosquitoes transfer not just sperm, but also seminal fluid proteins that may have profound effects on mated female biology and behavior. In this study, we investigated the role of male body size and mating history on semen depletion, female longevity, and reproductive success in Aedes aegypti L. Small and large males were mated in rapid succession with up to five females. Our results indicate that large males had greater mating capacity than small males. A reduction in fecundity by >50% was observed in females that were fourth to mate with small males in comparison with females that mated earlier in sequence. For females mated to large males, this reduction became evident for females that mated fifth in sequence. No loss of fertility (measured as hatch rate) was observed in females that were third-fifth in mating sequence compared with females mated to virgin males. When females were maintained on a low-quality (5% sucrose) diet, those mated to virgin males had a greater longevity compared with females mated third in sequence. We conclude that small males experience more rapid seminal depletion than large males, and discuss the role of semen depletion in the mated female. Our results contribute toward a better understanding of the complexity of Ae. aegypti mating biology and provide refined estimates of mating capacity for genetic control efforts.","inCitations":["bcacd1015c1606a0bbeb13228e5c616d0e1e08b5","773c6c018247d4d26ae53233831b0dff4f9624fc","2212ebf4bc6fde756e9ab2bc00002cad55513898","e264d6552200d2868186dd43309babc3626dea8f","929f87bafa83e2a5fd1ac26493731a0cc43eeda8","98d215eef4e7d0899a69904b17071e7853f58729","4828e50a2c512fc6a700902fd9ff694033a4eb62","cb69e8f7600427fba8066c72f9c8876a19a84bdf","9a2d52233d1cae378ebb3dee428a3fe2ef63edfa","5e11fd0d635292d35e7605c925ff03d2751f62f5","6fdbd197cd9afa1e53c7e33473f93a9cde0e3080","bc95ebda08dae025b4b1153c4a5c078d6689aad9","e05925873d4995becd9bde208ab06c7daae146bd","d03ebdcd0c401c6e62d3221090db5faf34ab7e4f","3f820014ea3cf22e18637838876407a3e5b1bc51","cfd23c5ef3e7648a03dbca3a4821aa1c7ac85b73","b1437ece877d8f5568c1f556ae2f77b04d968694","b5a68fb40367c15dc220dfaf7d9a5e2a2b4885b7","9f56db84558bcfe92438ed596c2e5f7de07b62d8","44033148ec70312358c21b5f7fbfe78beeb775f4","fa9d3a2b4aa493ad1823e4a596e1f28ecaf78858","0cb33eed28a62a41ea212cb7dee778d29c2326ac","c1700b6006c781f3c4046922d07f9492c9a5e20c","5b9dac0256a70ef8b0137de243b1147759474b21","8e96d375206586befdfd97b2cb37f8a8e0359a1b","8522fb6705245d9781ba60892a66a7d67d8477dd","09e427337235536d71f96545529963d60a1c5520","cb6d3337e9feb69eb34f5acd62ebe487d0736e09","208515db623760aac9dfd1cb517d58e89f753821","adebf9228076e589a7370b04bd636bb4d26f2c26","bbba9713e28f00e4fa32f6f8d099a71bec869a6c","3a30b2a8eb10955ec1ab0aac9280658deb8b98f2","c836603308e45f023c55b8e0d6e96616632c3c62","03388f43c31c9c9743c8374c52f87f26f88ea5b1","7aad51aa9e7ad27130e04c0a6288fc4ad38d55fa","48a672860363a97c91b29e164aa0dbdec08ec6c3","b36909d204ff38a1d854d00ac1eddd71fd32cfce","e4316ac8a66adc2e33537ae01322d0386b64ce2b","7fe670d1590fa4b222702990267776983c5f9b16","320641181cbdd3a6683ccac024a9d1b59c93f0a4","8efd57704455898382d5c558037e8e24b6957852","db164a6938a04036960b8f1272cfe69092f4756a","7a89182e11dd71f0e523ba212c6d35b9c4039537","947436779986c815dad19e07f058bfccb1d6c466"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Male Mating History and Body Size Influence Female Fecundity and Longevity of the Dengue Vector Aedes aegypti","doi":"10.1603/ME10071","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1603/ME10071","venue":"Journal of medical entomology"}

It is a system, however, that causes difficulty to those just being introduced to its concepts. EVM measures schedule performance not in units of time, but rather in cost, i.e. dollars. After overcoming this mental obstacle, we later discover another quirk of EVM: at the completion of a project which is behind schedule, Schedule Variance (SV) is equal to zero, and the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) equals unity. We know the project completed late, yet the indicator values say the project has had …perfect schedule performance!! A senior executive receiving the project performance report, minimally knowledgeable of EVM, cannot understand why he has an angry customer screaming, “Your product delivery is late!” This paper discusses the dilemma with the EVM schedule indicators, SV and SPI. A method for resolving the problem is presented in the paper. It is shown that the result from the method is schedule indicators having the same behavior as those for cost.","inCitations":["6b0713bb443528e0a2c0867557f7d08271614d81","46914141cf5efef401a6e1a4dcfbfc1a6c926949","f145ca15066b077fbd3a82ca1506ff652edefcc0","515b6d644a1543441b1da6ccecefad315439b0f9","f04f285792fc576dbaf96a225815b7d5169e6fea"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.earnedschedule.com/Docs/Earned%20Schedule.pdf","http://www.earnedschedule.com/Docs/Earned%20Schedule%20-%20schedule%20performance%20analysis%20from%20EVM%20measures.pdf"],"title":"Earned Schedule Schedule performance analysis from EVM measures","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Wifehood, it is held, is always personal, but motherhood is the abandonment of personality, the core of renunciation (Advaita Ashrama, 1912). Among all presuppositions that cultural imaginaries and social practices harbor about the female self, procreation has been seen as women’s default and ultimate purpose. In the Indian ethos, motherhood is their a priori dharma, a term that also connotes righteous, moral duty. Social rhetoric is suffused with maternal tropes: “Every woman is a mother in embryo. That is her supreme function in life. That is her social mission”, said Lala Lajpat Rai, a leader of India’s independence movement (Kishwar 1999). Vivekananda, an acclaimed 19 th century saint said “the ideal woman in India is the mother…marvellous, unselfish, all-suffering…” (Vivekananda 1951). A popular religious manual for Hindu women states “The word ‘Ma’ has an inexplicable purity….the foundation of true love requires forgoing self-interest and the supreme form of such love can be seen in mothers’ love….(it) does not have the stench of sexual desire…she is not corrupted by selfishness….” (Dawar 1948: 202). Such idioms are not a relic of India’s past but thrive contemporaneously as women continue to be seen and see themselves as mothers—imagined, symbolic and corporeal. The normative Woman-Mother animates its cinema, literature and even government programmes i and policies ii . Of late, she has inspired India’s multi-million dollar surrogacy industry and even state-funded IVF centres, a far cry from enforced sterilizations and the mass family planning drive of the 1970s. Such is the cultural clout of motherhood that it leaves women with little or no choice about their own identity and aspirations. Clearly then, among all gendered roles, motherhood is a rich realm to understand what we have come to know and refer to as the ‘self’ iii . Self-sacrifice, self-abnegation or simply selflessness are assumed, expected and extolled as inherently feminine and specifically maternal traits. Be it judges in the Bombay High Court who observed that “A wife should be like goddess Sita who left everything and followed her husband Lord Ram to a forest… iv or the Irish authorities who neglected a dying woman to save her unborn child v , the principle of coverture or the refusal of law to recognize rape within marriage, women’s selfhood is commonly negated through values that legitimize its surrender. While women do not passively inhabit such pre-existing, hegemonic figurations that preordain their self-identities, the omnipotence of maternal prescription and the consequent heteronomy that women’s lives are subject to cannot be denied. In these conditions of pervasive normativity, this paper asks if there is scope, however limited, for women to","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Shadow of Motherhood: Writing the Outlier Self","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Ces hypotheses concernent la regulation, ses objets, son organisation, ses liens avec la memoire du systeme didactique.

Nous avons degage qu'une tache est d'autant mieux reussie que sa resolution se regule a partir d'objets symboliques (codages) qui mettent a distance l'objet meme de la tache.

These cells contain cytochrome P450 enzymes that have recently demonstrated a number of exciting roles besides detoxification. The P450 monooxygenases can covert the substrate arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), metabolites that mediate vasodilation, mitogenesis, platelet aggregation, Ca2+ signaling and steroidogenesis. Integration of other physiological pathways present in astrocytes with P450 mediated EET formation has generated a number of interesting hypotheses to yield deeper insight into the role of astrocytes in the brain. In order to test these hypotheses as well as to enhance the benefits of EETs in astrocytes, we have used viral-mediated gene transfer and overexpression of one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, 2C11, to engineer astrocytes for gene manipulation and possible gene therapy. This review outlines evidence for the presence of EETs in astrocytes, the function of EETs and the progress made with viral vectors expressing epoxygenase for gene manipulation in astrocytes.","inCitations":["841d11ecd3e367c0ea6a5fcd3e9f427b94836359","f4b19de579ba143b2bb81800dad1d568ed1d9cee","f2ce5685766f61b5d550b328f09f2220d455ef9d","b141786546d9ad99b5d4062f946117f1cb4eb7c6","9655acfda1e79333b2a0ab0caedad2de37c72c76","fe50e3adc79d5d108d18b69ab0cb2a0a1a1addd2","00b710fe5e13cfce5c7989552cec0b38e540a45d","14f635fbda8e2d768c797c564bf59459a475a98c","b9494aae72daa00e9c5aaae7536de82a01907c25","e12aabb2deb1412b28a50804d6abfa1997285b56","cf23efbca1fe6425b2dd0d86a30fff24c40c666d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Functional role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and their production in astrocytes: approaches for gene transfer and therapy (review).","doi":"10.3892/ijmm.2.6.661","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2.6.661","venue":"International journal of molecular medicine"}

The bridges were constructed in the 1890rs using cast iron piers and through girder spans. Queensland Rail Network Pty Ltd identified significant deterioration in the cast iron piers and placed speed restrictions on two of the bridges. In 2009 Jacobs SKM were engaged to undertake a detailed study to determine whether it was feasible to repair and maintain the bridges in service or whether they should be replaced. The paper describes the methods adopted to establish the current load rating of the bridges, i.e., the strength capacity to withstand the maximum load applied by the QR rating vehicle. In addition, the paper describes the measures that have been recommended to prevent further deterioration of the cast iron piers and to improve the capacity of the bridge piers to withstand train braking loads. A comprehensive program of materials testing, finite element analysis, and load testing of the Burnett River Bridge was carried out and will be discussed in the paper. The study recommended the adoption of an innovative system of hydraulic llock-upr devices to transfer train braking loads from the more heavily loaded piers to other piers, and the application of carbon fibre wrapping to regain the pier strength that has been reduced by corrosion. These modifications will enable the bridge to remain in service for a further 25 to 30 years.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Life extension of aging railway bridges: a case study of the Burnett River Bridge","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Apart from organic diseases associated with obesity, the psychological repercussion is very important and requires a specific caring. Conservative treatments containing diet, physical-activity and drugs often show limits in particular when the patient presents food behavioural disorders. The bariatric surgery is presented like an ultimate therapy. It is a specific treatment which involves risks and high cost for the patient. This study is based on a qualitative study including patients coming to a gastric bypass in order to appreciate the surgical indications and to describe the individual motivations which lead the patients to request this intervention. The study consists of semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients. The majority of the patients do not correspond to the criteria defined by the law. The psychological repercussion of obesity compared to the family sight and the society seems to constitute a crucial factor in the recourse to the gastric bypass. The motivations to undergo this intervention are: importance attached to the physique, need for being with the mode, for answering at the request of a spouse or for decreasing health risks. The social support of the family and friends, during and after the intervention is a key component of the success and the acceptability of the intervention. This study proposes to re-examine the criteria of access to the bariatric surgery and to ensure a psychological accompaniment before and after the intervention. That is important for patients who are badly informed about conditions and consequences of the intervention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.amub.be/revue-medicale-bruxelles/download/861"],"title":"Analyse qualitative des facteurs favorisant le recours au bypass gastrique.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Whole cell voltage-clamp responses were recorded in brain slices from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the medial PFC and VC of rats aged p16-p21. Mixed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) having AMPA receptor (AMPAR)- and NMDAR-mediated components were isolated in nominally 0 Mg2+ ACSF. Averaged mEPSCs were well-fit by double exponentials. No significant differences in the NMDA/AMPA ratio (PFC: 27 +/- 1%; VC: 28 +/- 3%), peak mEPSC amplitude (PFC: 19.1 +/- 1 pA; VC: 17.5 +/- 0.7 pA), NMDAR decay kinetics (PFC: 69 +/- 8 ms; VC: 67 +/- 6 ms), or degree of correlation between NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated mEPSC components were found between the areas (PFC: n = 27; VC: n = 28). Recordings from older rats (p26-29) also showed no differences. EPSCs were evoked extracellularly in 2 mM Mg2+ at depolarized potentials; although the average NMDA/AMPA ratio was larger than that observed for mEPSCs, the ratio was similar in the two regions. In nominally 0 Mg2+ and in the presence of CNQX, spontaneous activation of NMDAR increased recording noise and produced a small tonic depolarization which was similar in both areas. We conclude that this basic property of excitatory transmission is conserved across PFC and VC synapses and is therefore unlikely to contribute to differences in firing patterns observed in vivo in the two regions.","inCitations":["d2c7de99e79fa21762027cb0afee27ca63d114e0","fc565e7f20aa42848a3b33f433025c88e06126d6","5e6bb3dcc11af8fc5dbc35ee1e420bd8e153d665","727e51d2571be3841103ab071c23c43d024e371a","7d6b1cbd5a109f5d117666d5ece15869ec053304","b3ce49921e1bbdfe526cb42281e7ab0e871fd539","5802a60454115a53d747cffac7a65742bf29d20b","45405157f16405fed71ff02f9292274fb47dc053","563da44a8a37c810e3c23aa78185578baef06b3b","dcf5b7a1434f96caf82d926e802ccf1ab8aa6bab","2bc72c54e172c2de37216bebc3aa1c81cf8e8804","81bd3126566f4893e11c505fdb4f7c20ed058187","c2f038bff13763eda6e979289cfdef60689444ca","5cbc891ec5522d02e40155b3dd3b8408b88431d0","bb469c98ed6475792d6afd3fbeefbbf6c5c6aa77","26b3e46e531b847785f158b74698def810ffe126","aacfca0bf401da1d8541ab902ab54427a22d03e2","833c4f5dec640a4317f60a3e1e2fb7a7cc913e47","27f25402d4e1d515aa8cc342edb18e5aa7bb16ec","2726fed1f259d4393a89d7f1038879817b5b09bd","fd088d918a0eccadfd20c1384721056bcf0d528d","87d72cfab1c02702be1a5e25cd29858c63a6c8ac","d6c3e482cd32ef1554a9c0e9fe352951d6ac34dd","11dda45d3cdee73582143bc8a0097b6787a07c4b","05822f7953d868a8d763de40b91bc7de24ec06c6","24d3a6c1398e18439fbee6b0bfa001273e981330","57e8b6d843da768cd942a5367679952534f4ba29","46f639a94c571af887b3cf5b4f7283bc7db2237a","6a45e2ec3d8479f1d1315d93bee9ef84b6e23066","ee80e213fc5220c0387fa4eafe4a1f5b40dc612f","6212c08e593aa2a0b767b81d73e5f925b2dd5597","3915f3ddcbb8c346dde957debdb7da707c40d395","9f224bd951407f0e04ba2d4b677fe8aaadd42f26","9c8d0e493fb74031cad905199b4f5b44c15b9757","27fc29a62b6f7dfb9c11f4c2f5d9b7af027ae68e","b0d3686cd480018a8974634b44f5589fbd4e5d5b","0bde3bf015b68609d548747b8160689419607ee6","9b911576f30824ee76de5eb46b5b2109df557861","c2bead4db580b261537a5185846b8f62203717c5","e01867a5faf26255d9d3517182b392a51189bffd","b4f03ecea041c201235258269d68003c9a01e1b2","0c761492eb7b2ec9854deb09c42c463ae5a50573","8cb87c89f4b549bd4b3ec5000f98efd2adf4b5f6","725ae2f1d536bacdc20921541b0c7c64a5d55d2c","4eb059db500e694d2d2c9352563ee3f476f5643b","194e4a2840a8ac947bd98e9bac984ec0e8e76adc","0dcf679e2132b76e9e8deb2a750623539e5d89b2","38cc47b51300036969521470a1e29593b17c95d3","da3b4e8a166011692a783eb13aa3a141c7172191","0a674803de698f863a9f86546216bd60f53f9dae","ebff75fb3a7e36eb640b56e4f03832b37f534665","9af276061d14797eb37ad87efc5913582c8cd559","207698a7d5f63bf8a7c082b0e167f59ad91a0631","3465655f694d8db7c8325f430f17c040dea84549","2cb3b46eae4fe8c10abea1abc4979ae9a8e6b551","d128fd016739f6c13e5037e0824b3de8a97e7e24","e7fcbd4800a2bf7e701903f1c99d436de8759e0e","00a87402cb99b523185f8c4c58226a15b84216cf","adccab633b3ef1c21c5837d3d4c2935175e50c95","cd308a9210953fc3e1d971b42a6ed1fab7e68e2e","0decac39a02ad98f1d67047eecdc1dd3cd278bfc","bf520f4b70dec4e37ac0acdbf095d0094d89abb6","e2c2a0d357a03bf19c65f6f4b82568d83b453641","bed9fdc91c74d6769ace8a4b7a3c6dd1cf146959","cdf26967ade4d7298a0c5859df75ef72bd01f99c","8fb7b4849bbe0a0420f9ca844a27302e1a5d0df4","d00dec556ea1b4293f95459f39d4ed615f759f34","67a02e8988df6c4de110ef0d5642a4d9bd95cabf","6a9026f13d8188038b8acb5be8f819c288221646","2ff146e307d886d936b97478c80a3bd73007fa81","60a6bd5eb48146beb8281a643243ca7c63cbd0ea","a05a9a4070da5841ed9c136e05629039701cd523","690f51e8226b87484d3aaddca27dc04ec5f82d69","e17e10bb404ff84db84a9be06160c16589f51d0f","6ac5818a758df1167a4e78257388b3523d0c4c56","b5e8e2c55d5d31b5cfebb11f10cb7a29fd12bf70","a1ae86338343f83d2854cd14ebc7a22f05803fd0","1feb5d014f29ebaa1fd53f672f64e897bbd433da","b91f773ec530f9779261011ba6bef7eaa8fa0213","42c222f52ee99fe1c549b25b6320660016602948","3613e1556b18442c6d0e19d2e5601b4993cff9ad","765f5eab0a6ad1e6357dd41c0b7e649c5d38b148","5d93c0b2d32c21b419b1e5c7b2c79cbdc76e1f7f","f561bd1aa015e3fac2c1d8fcd55dc6b9048ba9be","6a5e68d7f754df8fd2b881e6565a07fdebc4370e","dfb9c85111d9ee0a10ab607d379e4608272549a9","c4db0c69f738eceedfb52d66225589477737bded","89151855b5246c2370cd050a4cd470feb93464f0","eb041f3664d8cf59e9c2d6fb8d354f885faf650d","116a1b611b0b567004dc9a497d60bd05ef4f2d11","a895969e842fd1586a6ca657bbc371c1af3569d2","8ca522fe21aa197c1425a5332c9a21d43c4fea7d","deb18d0e29730b58a477050ca762f45afce3c1d7","2f7e04ff386594a09b79e0b8183dafc1d3cb346c","24321dd13e7ab8904fb7385082b5f011fe5b3540","0b5519ae6cf51990b948f7a23b931bcfebc43885","c932a38de74f37054d5aea4175036efcb655602f","909f6026aa73b357cbd8df0acfbf7e9442e2f88c","d4714164ae3fe20df88c14f187bd98bc8ab8abed","3446d87097a84014a11a445c6f87c5e2535f61a9","6d07eb5ef9eda742a2a21713509bb0e97972d99a","a8cab76d63ded2e18c2c12fb3a3a96285632d703","161ba93621d6fb5a96e9c8f1dc3774da4eb0abfd","34ba4bbda0c16c92f10fae8e7e6764dfa08f660a","38ea8eee35899031cbed42a3a18f3e71ff06b2c9","fde20ae7c2e2fe9369e038c43ec4be9bd232e9e2","e1353cc6c87ab27db8b0871509e5223e52a19be5","8633958615571665fd853e83c30e09b660470323","6258cbe66eff5eae767a7689fdf7c0cd18fee3a9","0c8436fb7d5b38d6ed4d8846195dc6761ea2eb27","dd4742dbaaebaa8f8b838f42d31fcf1f5a85455d","f1266367e22c1bf2445094dd2db6889ef54b3646","b04ec11fd677e80adbb6b49f405fa77d5b86af91","6d9d28ffa52aa3a11765190f89486011a0c29f91","06091488f3ed5907cdea0e7f90c59a7670b0466b","609148662024d4bca29fc1f2c45bb

In particular, it examined the linguistic characteristics of 132 pieces of e-mail writing by ESL students in tasks that differed in terms of purpose, audience interaction and task structure. The analysis focused on the linguistic features of the students' e-mail writing at different levels, i.e. syntactic complexity, lexical complexity and grammatical accuracy. Computerized text analysis programs were used to ensure internal consistency of the linguistic analysis. Statistical analysis of the results using the repeated measures analysis of variance and post hoc contrast tests showed significant syntactic, lexical and grammatical differences in the students' e-mail writing of the different tasks. Specifically, in e-mail tasks involving audience interaction, students tended to produce syntactically and lexically more complex texts, and in tasks which allowed students self-selection of topics and content, students also tended to use more complex sentences and richer and more diverse vocabulary. However, an interesting trade-off effect was observed between linguistic complexity and grammatical accuracy in the students' e-mail writing, indicating the complexity of the second language writing process. The study provides pedagogical implications for designing effective e-mail tasks for enhancing second language writing development.","inCitations":["ba85e53fceced61d826bbee604498caaf211ec2c","ee9347c2ef415b2a4a3102b7e5ed95e8b75e8beb","8541ccc84f546e42c21b31acbcaf1fc9c4d71cd2","af4a512d91afaaa649a9a437f2b7f61c2405e6b3","a7ef24d66eeccd01e89ed48aaaad20335e6e2e1a","7c2ebf74ed5e6d251895ed0ceb3357b54a887314","7a31cdf21c608dd520ccd9cc3209ee3803b92812","3d8d1c53f3319d7284400788a08716d514bc0d79","36085296f40dae1d53eee4c579e6f5afc1796f48","2a2d4e3f88039f0c79372e32176642f35874c3bc","7c9b8a7c10108eb73ccc793b20383b98572330e1","f18ee780a73021783b426241d28d338684867a20","3ad4485a85b3650e4433a80598efae8943e348d0","ca6f907020438930771a48502b1295ad5e51fcc0","fb5154f98f2fda80f79fadd65ddc46e3e4abc14e","804f72830bb5849015f661d0e17d2dcadfcd68b5","049aa5226c63a92bef796eff22e4928d9da5608c","b6a7353bd7fbedc6aaad449a3695a84ec3955855","0054a7afa1746119cb710c97765c6ea2f32c90f5","f70282df3d16210a593ca7ca629d87372e6f7bb3","014fa14e35ab4632c8b26ab84d1b1f000bbeb4ab","8453f019d2cebcfe684513dee8bbfca02a6d85ec","4a333de7c23b5d06c5b40c1b78f630cbabb3a224","a7bff203a48e33d3d573909cb46aaed2cf0941bf","ee24685755d383c83dc0a3caad0ba400816cc2d5","7675ccb5e3d83a2c4956e09c1052a2b305c7668a","5d61dcef9adf76f8562e968fe36329a481eda8ca","6c1fd036fc864f50ddff4ad4447d8d0d49374b22","16ab68f0096ac5e46c13b5e7260b604c5a26b8b0","d01e0799946bde62eedbc828a1bf315c370e8a1d","af21651703b6ed7367cec5513c7860e713daba25","55890a2acaeba70ae649f1468e316df9c9bdab3d","e50bcd5f6adc74551cf1ff40a3c6af60ed17ad1f","9d72fa2cc0f7cb9dfd6d8437fcacc9e80beaff44","8d83fab77bc0ff258319566d65ad4b65f27bb116","92c2defb1263697a51b0ae6b77f415d18326b7f0","cc4e0ecaa721aa866e9fec2ff2ecbc0df026bbaa","11beeed3c0fb38ffe2e4af3f38451d4a06c736b2","e9337744c7cd26aa8951a00b7266abb7a9005705","2aaae3fb2a516d865c30996761612261a80c1325","fc9786144f237a7cec2477470f4c1f614a30ab18","e1827e8cb6fb4199d1709c659c062f633516b078","0d72d1a1c18044679d5ea5cf8a88195c64cc46f8","3ee1f97658284334f82e5673baf70ae009605e72","4635b35d97481c501135e64454f304190d3afe90","ffa24d66ba46ebeccda8bb6d0453d56a11fa9b6b","8126a2e5ccd69d4af76e1482db4444a854ee51db","da25e8b95630d6aa9b5d470b040c9d57bb01c8e0","c7a1b7795f12c6678bde18d0f4271a6b42638cff","5fc3b7e8c08c9170b770bcbeffc0c1f4c0da2dce","866cf1626e7a1b9e33e3ff04542188c6015cbff5","51f90a65d1683b602f7076146b6d63a58aa4c26c","9b8fa07ffb7fd5aa2562b05b1ccd41246d7a2e75","16619e20506f8f5f096d96e6b6bd29217910df2d","90fb4af4e826a1b8a44ce3944b19139dd6415c45","00897469a8875ffa4d9ffbdf74909a994f77eb61"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Linguistic Characteristics of Esl Writing in Task-based E-mail Activities","doi":"10.1016/S0346-251X(00)00009-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X%2800%2900009-9","venue":""}

Almost 90% of potable water and about 70% of irrigation water are provided from the GW sources. So the GW plays a vital role in our daily life and all the groundwater quality (GWQ) parameters should be within the standard limit. The GW especially in southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh is contaminated with various problems. The salinity increment in coastal region of Bangladesh has been an alarming issue which affects the water supply system and scarcity of potable water. Two wards of Jogipole union parishad at Dighalia Upazila in Khulna are selected to conduct the study and a preliminary survey was done on the study area. GW sources are selected and eight samples are collected from each ward. All samples are tested according to the standard procedures of laboratory and values are compared with the standard values of drinking water. From a questionnaire survey on the dwellers of the study area it was found that most of the people have been suffering from high blood pressure, kidney disease, gastric and respiration problem. From the laboratory test it was found that the GW of the study area possesses with high concentration of color, turbidity and manganese. The salinity is very high for the excessive concentration of chloride present in GW. Total dissolves solids (TDS) in GW of the study area is very high although others parameters are within standard limit. Finally the suitability of GW samples are checked for suitability of drinking water by comparing all tests values with the standard value of ECR, 1997 and WHO, 2006.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iccesd.com/proc_2016/Papers/ICCESD-2016-465.pdf"],"title":"A Study on Groundwater Quality and Its Effect on Human Health in Jogipole Union Parishad","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Preliminary data suggested that cells follow a biphasic response to this change hinging on the initiation of lipid accumulation, and we hypothesized that drastic repatterning of metabolism also followed this biphasic modality. To test this hypothesis, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolite changes that occur under nitrogen (N) deprivation were analyzed. Eight sampling times were selected covering the progressive slowing of growth and induction of oil synthesis between 4 and 6 h after N deprivation. Results of the combined, systems-level investigation indicated that C. reinhardtii cells sense and respond on a large scale within 30 min to a switch to N-deprived conditions turning on a largely gluconeogenic metabolic state, which then transitions to a glycolytic stage between 4 and 6 h after N depletion. This nitrogen-sensing system is transduced to carbon- and nitrogen-responsive pathways, leading to down-regulation of carbon assimilation and chlorophyll biosynthesis, and an increase in nitrogen metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. For example, the expression of nearly all the enzymes for assimilating nitrogen from ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, urea, formamide/acetamide, purines, pyrimidines, polyamines, amino acids and proteins increased significantly. Although arginine biosynthesis enzymes were also rapidly up-regulated, arginine pool size changes and isotopic labeling results indicated no increased flux through this pathway.","inCitations":["8e80803fbf702d85e3f8be7ea776e5c15e4d5226","dffb22aa19e5fbfd22af4164216cf8742c2ea289","feae0e8b1acbeb2ed70084192ae26568777bb61c","aac0f852be4c2d349549912ac7bd2061c1886e08","ad2195045a8199acd754c2c4d005e0633e34c6ca","5c63dda865427b23d838395958d009d1ea21bd54","35dc6eaee3d2f4df53f8d1a0deccabfa14af6fe4","58e40a38d03c72ed571a95441848a1be9bb47236","824bd607ac5a0d8e2b08296952de09f1438f5ab6","39d465f6a0cbcb5b0e2213fdd9e3a13c408ebf4d","45018cd72cf9d462a67e4c6ad07c25b4e0af752c","a3b70ae57897b6056dfb139b117e6db9334b73d2","8b90fe1cbfab294a0ebbfbb8e95800d862d6fba2","1bc24ca32cb751a36839aff69759490bbc5e98ee","fca979aee1eb16ef6c98e705ac9c647fb4f074ce","c169a1e0ec1e5de3e5c881552d772f4f91ba80e2","a4b1e272a704d820053c6d4ec11ccb981496a603","b54eb9b5ee70c7ae5087ec34a0eba77c5c48d306","88ec84645e1bbcbb6ece713f8fe11f21708bc18f","d2bf8a91299337f90f94d3adaeb4b30aa4e81703","3a4f45e58ab22bef2e4e25664886b6db9ed0615c","efbbd2c3f7ee49466f3c2d8c40eb9e5c7252a10e","4e512c5eb9c23fb7f2b8c272f62794785f2f1de9","d38b351c7e8439e030d1c01f51ab31cbcc967807","d983a8bdb8acf025bdd4588bdb5accacc5bc0007","56eeab2cc61e12e6537196982c012350e1c1e73f","711af45a508d110289bd1f70b29a8e5ea0537242","78faa13b7b723b9e286229512bd1869dfd0b98bc","b7e1b695a349c4805027d70e8f58374b7c58541c","d54d38aeee1962c115b107089032e285a99a19b6","bd7d7e3f6b862fb60112aa67d04bac36d3f4618b","d811e11acf25966503155ed2aaf9db5462934c55","cf2dcc3665ac2db5514b66fcb32bab76fac0ff5b","3cce179b6f5398279b2950b116247593de3020c3","4d648f37a832dcc92a894367f8551a276dbd2b9c","a6b40337b1887982251f92a66b166d2384fad228","575d57f8a6693b78f88df4ea5b4e0d29ae365ed6","85cb9e4ff705b5bfaab8ed5a2f196dd014f72722","899a1558944a0ca8306ed16bbcee23e21eea4a84","1cac3175809df4c10a0041e5d6bea9e78316d57c","29bd1281f3a9e1f8d63ec819dc55b0917dce2a3f","3a106350470fe2918319b4386076ffbc247fe0ed","d4ebfc19c3a331d25f44f1643f23a01d13d24a05","ea852e79a23e7471d3ff7d2b6e1fabd3f0a4b55f","fcb7ccc2a1f082bb5db0c345cb72aa30fd31580c","6a47f72cd9d78af67d83925dbfad7fa1c02b0208","2f7adda71e20f39575baca2f46e053d4841b85a9","98d01d32dfa96c5fee915f23e96724e243b86dfc","8a5e493f003501705cda6a0f637633c378e3040b","7e6ec8cdb35c63685de1e0f6aab1c12be477a49b","40c98c7a29a406b810c148f2b96c484c9ab06ec1","3f159f4390c4bd99530e829946b96343e62da07c","35e3f2dcd4ce89cf4efcfe6dd07e48d49bd0e35b","393936f9ac6f2fc79e73110395521617a9f44745","c70ebf3e2a705caef31f83f45c07ebc744c03325","8e37667773a7ea9e9b695b7ee582eb5e4dd32cdc","ed800eebced92a4c15d201ee2062d1cbe4dedbbb","e65a5df4f76acc0a40049c7a0622f67ccad38355","7de512538a3e1cbd7685e67a8b744edfde0a0fad","d814d9ef003085f2b5923f7f79e086109c45862e","be30ac7e7fea76cb4f215a3ae47feda23d48e3bb","a93816b58d213038c2b6bb9802ab9c0f8d9d0ae4","c43cce44070a39373e3a8283e4a3019c20bb8571"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nitrogen deprivation: a systems biology analysis.","doi":"10.1111/tpj.12747","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.12747","venue":"The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology"}

An aqueous solution of AgNO3 added to the microemulsion was the source of Ag+ ions. The formation of AgBr nanoparticles in microemulsions through direct reaction with the surfactant counterion is a novel approach aimed at decreasing the role of intermicellar nucleation on nanoparticle formation for rapid reactions. The availability of the surfactant counterion in every reverse micelle and the rapidity of the reaction with the counterion trigger nucleation within individual reverse micelles. The effect of the following variables on the particle size and size distribution was investigated: the surfactant and cosurfactant concentrations, moles of AgNO3 added, and water to surfactant mole ratio, R. High concentration of the surfactant or cosurfactant, or high water content of the microemulsion favored intermicellar nucleation and resulted in the formation of large particles with broad size distribution, while high amounts of AgNO3 favored nucleation within individual micelles and resulted in small nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. A blue shift in the UV absorption threshold corresponding to a decrease in the particle size was generally observed. Notably, the variation of the absorption peak size with the nanoparticle size was opposite to those reported by us in previous studies using different surfactants.","inCitations":["398663ecc274684695910da7349488636eb5a0d1","c5478e3d269ac312825400049181278711c2ab0d","82bc92ade463a07e6b207b8ad88f031d19c36c31","b64f4903b7604bd7583d60a8d43d09740ed95049","f623f13d0a891ccd9b893a1d10fdabd37673814e","76b56c757157cdafe067d51bdf95da6d2d101e66","2a0669c215ff11bdf03c05438d4d655c29b3978b","eaa4f7684b71e39c4c706336189146fe7ff31e8c","99a1a2eabcc9b1d94cd87c6708a3c5d08857d7b1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preparation of AgBr Nanoparticles in Microemulsions Via Reaction of AgNO3 with CTAB Counterion","doi":"10.1007/s11051-006-9107-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-006-9107-4","venue":""}

Articles were published between January 2004 and April 2015.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant proportion of CRC survivors experience clinically meaningful levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms or reduced mental well-being across the trajectory of the illness. Demographic, medical, and psychosocial predictors of mental health outcomes were identified. However, few studies were theory-driven, and gaps remain in our understanding of risk and protective factors with respect to mental health outcomes, especially during long-term CRC survivorship.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTheory-driven longitudinal research with larger samples is required to identify subgroups of CRC survivors with different trajectories of psychological adjustment. Such research would assess adjustment as a function of internal resources (e.g., personality and coping) and external resources (e.g., finances and social support) to inform future interventions for CRC survivors.

This is mainly due to its ability to learn complex patterns and insights from massive datasets. With the increase in the data at a high rate, it is becoming necessary that the algorithms are resource-efficient and scalable. Gaussian processes are one of the efficient techniques in non linear modelling, but has limited practical applications due to its computational complexity. This thesis studies how parallelism techniques can be applied to optimize performance of Gaussian process regression and empirically assesses parallel learning of a sequential GP and a distributed Gaussian Process Regression algorithm with Random Projection approximation implemented in SPARK framework. These techniques were tested on the dataset provided by Volvo Cars. From the experiments, it is shown that training the GP model with 45k records or 219 ≈ 106 data points takes less than 30 minutes on a spark cluster with 8 nodes. With sufficient computing resources these algorithms can handle arbitrarily large datasets.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1412061/FULLTEXT01.pdf"],"title":"Scalable Gaussian Process Regression for Time Series Modelling","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Second, it reports on prototype system development in accordance with the scenario. The system (1) searches a string, corresponding to the data value entered by a cataloger or extracted from the Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) record, within the scanned and optical character recognition (OCR)-converted title page and verso of the title page of an item being cataloged; (2) identifies the place where the string appears within the source of information; (3) identifies the procedure being used to form the value entered or recorded; and finally (4) displays the place and procedure identified for the data value as its candidate evidence.

This digital transformation seems to have brought about a radical shift in how an individual perceives himself with respect to the external world, having pervasive implications for his sense of self. The primary aim of this paper is to synthesize the evolution of the self over the years by borrowing key concepts from the psychodynamic, humanistic and existential approaches in psychology through the rather irresistible lens of technology and study their relevance in the 21st century. It is important to critically look into the varying approaches that have attempted to understand the self. The paper acknowledges the significant rise in the use of social media and consequently raises serious and urgent questions for mental health professionals confronting issues arising from constant networking and its inevitable impact on individuals which has no basis and parallel in history to cater to the pressing needs of the eleventh hour.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Wired Self:An Evolution of Being","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

His personality should not be confused with his reputation among gossips, that of a man on the margin of society, who undertook the deliberate destruction of his work, or at any rate the conscious destruction of his own scientific school, even though it had been enthusiastically accepted and developed by firstrank colleagues and disciples. Grothendieck’s journey? A childhood devastated by Nazism and its crimes, a father who was absent in his early years and then disappeared in the storm, a mother who kept him in her orbit and long disturbed his relationships with other women. He compensated for this with a frantic investment in mathematical abstraction until psychosis, kept at bay through this very involvement, caught up with him and swallowed him in morbid anguish. Grothendieck is difficult to categorize. Like Carl Friedrich Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, and many other mathematicians, he was obsessed with the notion of space. But his originality lay in deepening of the concept of a geometric point. Such research may seem trifling, but the metaphysical stakes are considerable; the philosophical problems it engenders are still far from solved. In its ultimate form, this research, Grothendieck’s proudest, revolved around the concept of a motive, or pattern, viewed as a beacon illuminating all the incarnations of a given object through their various ephemeral cloaks. But this concept also represents the point at which his incomplete work opened to a void. Grothendieck’s idiosyncrasy prompted him fully to accept this flaw. Most scientists are somewhat keener to erase their footprints from the sand, silence their fantasies and dreams, and devote themselves to the statue within, as François Jacob puts it. From the depths of the isolation he has imposed upon himself since 1990, Grothendieck has sent us a vast, introspective work: Récoltes et Semailles (Crops and Seeds).

Several major advances over the last 45 years include restriction enzyme mapping, DNA sequencing, and PCR. Each advance generated much excitement, and its importance was recognized by the Nobel Prize. And now, once again, DNA technology has made a quantum leap. Even a few years ago it would have seemed preposterous to suggest that DNA analysis could be carried out on a thumbnail-sized glass chip. But that is exactly what is happening in several laboratories and biotechnology companies around the country. The brainchild of Stephen Fodor (President and Chief Executive Officer of Affymetrix with headquarters in Santa Clara, CA), the GeneChip, introduces the idea of parallel genomics—the marriage of two disciplines: biotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing. As excitement in the wonders of this technology mounts, an increasing number of university laboratories and several biotechnology companies are anticipating the needs of the experimenter by preparing to offer competing technology. Hopefully, this will allay the fears many scientists have of finding this technology inaccessible and ultimately unaffordable.","inCitations":["91e4691fdf9a5a6165e362eae245aee85fc398aa","30df2c00190fc1fa36d7406c7faae9c007168215","3fb027d8682b9c1ad9bb8296e0a3ad70301231f8","ff47285e18512832adee080ffaea7fcf444dbbbf","51dc0095ca9e117ab99304f8c12d9ec1dc26e6ba","b1ef1c59b543b8da14ea4a1f14180ac63930dc6f","08627cc556c90b478677cd90835e3e19b4ea9464"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"When the Chips are Down","doi":"10.1101/gr.7.10.943","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.7.10.943","venue":""}

The Syrian conflict has led to a collapse of infrastructure, including access to critical and lifesaving healthcare services. Women and children account for approximately 75% of internally displaced Syrians and refugees. This population is also particularly vulnerable to poor health outcomes, a condition worsened by lack of access to maternal and child health services. In response to this crisis, a partnership of Saudi and Syrian physicians established a non-profit healthcare facility named the Brotherhood Medical Center (BMC) to serve women and children within a safe area near the Syrian-Turkish border. The project began in September 2014 and was implemented in three phases of establishment, phased construction and formal launch and operation. Currently, the BMC is working at about 70% of its capacity and is run in partnership with the Syrian Expatriate Medical Association. Although there was strong initial support from donors, the BMC continues to face many financial and operational challenges, including difficulties in transferring money to Syria, shortage of medical supplies, and lack of qualified medical personnel. Despite these challenges, the BMC represents a critical model and an important case study of the challenges of delivering healthcare services to underserved populations during an ongoing conflict. However, more robust support from the international community is needed to ensure it continues its important health and humanitarian mission.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/305041/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fpubh-06-00108/fpubh-06-00108.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fpubh-06-00108.pdf&se=2019-11-28T16:55:31Z&sig=yRaZHqm%2B8K8q8FMFAOIBkyRC8/a2BzlHlx2Z/Gkgv/A%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"The Brotherhood Medical Center: Collaborative Foundation of Maternity and Children’s Healthcare Facility for Displaced Syrians","doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2018.00108","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00108","venue":"Front.

Despite multiple distribution studies, there remains a need for a method capable quantifying not only the site and amount of agent deposition but the rate of clearance as well.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive patients underwent endoscopic image capture of 3 subsites over 15 minutes following fluorescein-dyed irrigation using a squeeze bottle, nasal saline spray, or nasal gel spray. Area and intensity staining were quantified using a graphics editing program. Total intensity scores were compared using a Student t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe squeeze bottle was the only method demonstrating delivery to the oropharynx (37 ± 22 mm(2) ). The nasal gel resulted in the greatest coverage of the middle turbinate region (10 ± 15 mm(2) ) while the nasal saline spray (75 ± 31 mm(2) ) resulted in the greatest inferior turbinate coverage. No significant differences in clearance rates were found between delivery methods at any subsite.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis method is capable of quantifying both the area and intensity of fluorescein deposition using a variety of delivery methods. While small variations in subsite coverage were noted, all methods resulted in significant internal valve deposition. Despite differences in delivery volume and viscosity, all methods resulted in similar rates of fluorescein clearance.","inCitations":["692eb9eb307ec8bdcf1a22549530f55699174541","b148f0484501c01f86a5f1dfe1401538296bd722","7964d1ead5d3b6b8adfc82aa8a6035fe4af476d7","9e4bd123767d0a996697f7a0b1d541376199e169","7acb30ae6c7bf3c5aa4c01a57309e59b4e4bdf05","72184d92bad054fb4d1d0e43a06ad42f616b1d98","1362658fe904a170b4b00a3313926512b1a20fb5","610ad1a0cee1ae95ad67b66aac495240962542b3","23775a29cecb823471e42164f78870fde93bd23c","be27ead6217a9811938bceb7871244b3a71d3aa4","2e686ba0e92b7a5bedbe203b7226273ef7a5eb78","ccc69e9e04917b42aa16e8b2136c79d5766cc1d4","d178213ed2ee8fd2ec7959ba97c2ebc26c9ca1d5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Temporospatial quantification of fluorescein-labeled sinonasal irrigation delivery.","doi":"10.1002/alr.20041","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.20041","venue":"International forum of allergy & rhinology"}

Laboratory culture was initiated with 89 species of primary parasites and predators; 60 species were successfully cultured. Of these, 56 species were released in the field and 29 were recovered; six are established and have effected successful biological control ofSaissetia oleae (Olivier) andDialeurodes citri (Ashmead).","inCitations":["9a501f874985fd3d52e4bf6dbe081638ec1458fd","360766ac1fdde27c5cfe7ddd0709aef11f289be1","3773f2bf1684ca247a7b15cbad7c799ee3fbdd0a","93b062bcd148ef73af08b3e9c13a50354e5aceec","8dc1177208abe234edb25fc7181c3e5403fbf36b","14676a9624cca2d670c3eb8415d303391ced743d","6b62053b43d899f2bb4bd4549504a3efb204f59b","bec7de1c927efe305d899070d296ac9d7e4dfbbd","d42b346916d037eb3948d3d7bdf19ca2337eb690"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Introduction of beneficial insects into israel for the control of insect pests","doi":"10.1007/BF02979506","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02979506","venue":"Phytoparasitica"}
